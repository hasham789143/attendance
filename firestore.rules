/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with ownership constraints.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the owner (the user themselves).
 * - /sessions/class-current: Single document storing the current class attendance session. Accessible to admins only.
 * - /sessions/class-current/records/{userId}: Attendance records for the current class session, accessible to admins only.
 * - /sessions/hostel-current: Single document storing the current hostel attendance session. Accessible to admins only.
 * - /sessions/hostel-current/records/{userId}: Attendance records for the current hostel session, accessible to admins only.
 * - /sessions/{sessionId}: Archived attendance sessions, accessible to admins only.
 * - /sessions/{sessionId}/records/{recordId}: Attendance records for archived sessions, accessible to admins only.
 * - /chats/{studentUid}/messages/{messageId}: Chat messages for a specific student. Accessible to admins and the student.
 * - /settings/attendance: Application-wide settings. Accessible to admins only.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is allowed for admins only.
 * - Only admins can create, update, or delete attendance sessions and records.
 * - Chat messages are accessible to the student and admins.
 * - Settings are accessible to admins only.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - No denormalization is explicitly required in this ruleset. The role-based access control is determined by the `isAdmin()` function, which checks for the `admin` role in the custom claims.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Private user data is stored under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only the user and admins can access it.
