/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and allows admins to manage attendance sessions and access chat messages.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /sessions/class-current: Stores the current active class attendance session, writable only by admins.
 * - /sessions/class-current/records/{userId}: Stores attendance records for the current class session, writable by admins.
 * - /sessions/hostel-current: Stores the current active hostel attendance session, writable only by admins.
 * - /sessions/hostel-current/records/{userId}: Stores attendance records for the current hostel session, writable by admins.
 * - /sessions/{sessionId}: Stores archived attendance sessions, writable only by admins.
 * - /sessions/{sessionId}/records/{recordId}: Stores archived attendance records, writable only by admins.
 * - /chats/{studentUid}/messages/{messageId}: Stores chat messages. Admins can read and write all chats. Students can only read and write their own chats.
 * - /settings/attendance: Stores application-wide settings, writable only by admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - All write operations require user authentication.
 * - Admins have broad access to manage attendance sessions and settings.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `adminUid` field in `AttendanceSession` documents is used to quickly verify admin ownership.
